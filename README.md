Problem Description

This project uses the Shopping Behavior Dataset to analyze customer purchasing patterns. The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe based on demographic and shopping behavior features such as age, gender, purchase amount, category, payment method, and previous purchases.

The target variable in this project is Subscription Status, making this a supervised classification problem.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains 3900 records and 16 columns representing customer information and purchasing behavior. It includes numerical features (Age, Purchase Amount, Review Rating, Previous Purchases) and categorical features (Gender, Category, Location, Payment Method, etc.), making it suitable for machine learning classification tasks.

Methodology

The machine learning workflow includes:
	1.	Dataset Selection
	2.	Data Loading
	3.	Data Preprocessing
	4.	Train/Test Split
	5.	Model Training
	6.	Model Evaluation
	7.	Results
